# Let's call two numbers friend numbers if their representation in base 10 has
# at least one common digit.
# E.g. 1123 and 3981 are friend numbers.
#
# Let f(n) be the number of pairs (p,q) with 1â‰¤p<q<n such that p and q are
# friend numbers.
# f(100)=1539.
#
# Find f(10^18) mod 1000267129.

# THEORY:
#
# It's easier to find the number of unfriendly pairs first, then subtract that
# from the total number of pairs to get the number of friendly pairs.
#
# Initially, consider (p, q) and (q, p) distinct pairs; we'll divide by 2
# at the end.
#
# We can start by counting the integers with, and only with, a 1 in their
# digits, and multiplying them by the count of numbers only with (but not
# necessarily with) a 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 in their digits. Then we can repeat with
# 2 and 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. There are (9 choose 1) such cases.
#
# Next consider the integers with and only with a 0 and 1 in their digits.
# Multiply with the count of numbers only with 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
# Repeat with 0,2 and 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. There are (9 choose 1) such cases.
# (We need to consider 0 separately from the other digits because it's
# something of a special case; integers can't have leading 0's.)
#
# There are (9 choose 2) cases analogous to 1,2 and 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0.
# There are (9 choose 2) cases analogous to 0,1,2 and 3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
# There are (9 choose 3) cases analogous to 1,2,3 and 4,5,6,7,8,9,0.
# There are (9 choose 3) cases analogous to 0,1,2,3 and 4,5,6,7,8,9.
# etc.
# There are (9 choose 8) cases analogous to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9,0.
# There are (9 choose 8) cases analogous to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9.
#
# Add all these up, divide by 2, and subtract from the total number of pairs,
# which is (n-1)(n-2)/2.
