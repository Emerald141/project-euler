##Taking three different letters from the 26 letters of the alphabet,
##character strings of length three can be formed.
##Examples are 'abc', 'hat' and 'zyx'.
##When we study these three examples we see that for 'abc' two characters
##come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
##For 'hat' there is exactly one character that comes lexicographically
##after its neighbour to the left. For 'zyx' there are zero characters
##that come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
##In all there are 10400 strings of length 3 for which exactly one character
##comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
##
##We now consider strings of n â‰¤ 26 different characters from the alphabet.
##For every n, p(n) is the number of strings of length n for which exactly
##one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
##
##What is the maximum value of p(n)?
