# Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call
# it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C,
# the following properties are true:
#
# S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
# If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
# If S(A) is minimised for a given n, we shall call it an optimum special
# sum set. The first five optimum special sum sets are given below.
#
# n = 1: {1}
# n = 2: {1, 2}
# n = 3: {2, 3, 4}
# n = 4: {3, 5, 6, 7}
# n = 5: {6, 9, 11, 12, 13}
#
# It seems that for a given optimum set, A = {a1, a2, ... , an}, the next
# optimum set is of the form B = {b, a1+b, a2+b, ... ,an+b}, where b is the
# "middle" element on the previous row.
#
# By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for n = 6 to be
# A = {11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24}, with S(A) = 117. However, this is not the
# optimum set, as we have merely applied an algorithm to provide a near
# optimum set. The optimum set for n = 6 is A = {11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25},
# with S(A) = 115 and corresponding set string: 111819202225.
#
# Given that A is an optimum special sum set for n = 7, find its set string.
