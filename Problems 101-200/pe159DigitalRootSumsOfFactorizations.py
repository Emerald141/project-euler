##A composite number can be factored many different ways. For instance, not
##including multiplication by one, 24 can be factored in 7 distinct ways:
##
##24 = 2x2x2x3
##24 = 2x3x4
##24 = 2x2x6
##24 = 4x6
##24 = 3x8
##24 = 2x12
##24 = 24
##Recall that the digital root of a number, in base 10, is found by adding
##together the digits of that number, and repeating that process until a
##number is arrived at that is less than 10. Thus the digital root of 467 is 8.
##
##We shall call a Digital Root Sum (DRS) the sum of the digital roots of
##the individual factors of our number.
##The chart below demonstrates all of the DRS values for 24.
##
##Factorisation	Digital Root Sum

##2x3x4

##2x2x6
##10
##4x6
##10
##3x8
##11
##2x12

##24
##6
##The maximum Digital Root Sum of 24 is 11.
##The function mdrs(n) gives the maximum Digital Root Sum of n.
##So mdrs(24)=11.
##Find âˆ‘mdrs(n) for 1 < n < 1,000,000.
