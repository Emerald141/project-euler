##A robot moves in a series of one-fifth circular arcs (72Â°), with a free
##choice of a clockwise or an anticlockwise arc for each step, but no
##turning on the spot.
##
##Given that the robot starts facing North, how many journeys of 70 arcs
##in length can it take that return it, after the final arc, to its
##starting position?
##(Any arc may be traversed multiple times.)
