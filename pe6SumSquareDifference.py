##The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
##
##1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
##The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
##
##(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
##Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
##ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
##
##Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
##one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
