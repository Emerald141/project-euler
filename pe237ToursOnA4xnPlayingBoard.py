##Let T(n) be the number of tours over a 4 Ã— n playing board such that:
##
##The tour starts in the top left corner.
##The tour consists of moves that are up, down, left, or right one square.
##The tour visits each square exactly once.
##The tour ends in the bottom left corner.
##
##T(10) is 2329. What is T(10 ** 12) modulo 10 ** 8?

##This piece of code follows a fairly complex thought process which
##would be just about impossible to explain to somebody else, and
##which I myself might have a hard time understanding should I
##return here later for whatever reason.
##
##Basically it involves listing the markings in each possible column,
##then running a simulation to see how many gridpaths can end with
##that particular column path. Some of these column paths will always
##have the same number of possibilities as some others, so those are
##grouped together in the algorithm.
##
##By using the results for 10 * (x-1) steps for a given set of these
##tiles, it is possible to find the results for 10 * x steps in those
##same tiles.
