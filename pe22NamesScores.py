##Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a
##46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin
##by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the
##alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its
##alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
##
##For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
##COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th
##name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
##
##What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
