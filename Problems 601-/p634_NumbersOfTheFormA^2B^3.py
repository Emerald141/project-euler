# Define F(n) to be the number of integers xâ‰¤n that can be written in the form
# x=a^2*b^3, where a and b are integers not necessarily different and both
# greater than 1.
#
# For example, 32=2^2*2^3 and 72=3^2*2^3 are the only two integers less than
# 100 that can be written in this form. Hence, F(100)=2.
#
# Further you are given F(2*10^4)=130 and F(3*10^6)=2014.
#
# Find F(9*10^18).

# THEORY:
# This representation is unique if we require b to be either squarefree or
# the square of a prime, and in the latter case, if we require p^3 does not
# divide a for any prime p < b. We can figure this last condition out by
# inclusion-exclusion (strategy borrowed from problem 268).
