# The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by,
# tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:
# 
# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
# 
# By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding
# to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form
# a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is
# 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number
# then we shall call the word a triangle word.
# 
# Using words.txt, a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand
# common English words, how many are triangle words?
