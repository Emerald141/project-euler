# The sum of the kth powers of the first n positive integers can be expressed
# as a polynomial of degree k+1 with rational coefficients,
# the Faulhaber's Formulas:
# 1^k + 2^k + ... + n^k = a_1 n + a_2 n^2 + ... + a_{k+1} n^(k+1),
# where a_i's are rational coefficients that can be written a
# reduced fractions p_i/q_i (if a_i = 0, we shall consider q_i = 1).
#
# For example, 1^4 + 2^4 + ... + n^4 = -1/30 n + 1/3 n^3 + 1/2 n^4 + 1/5 n^5.
#
# Define D(k) as the value of q_1 for the sum of k'th powers
# (i.e. the denominator of the reduced fraction a1).
# Define F(m) as the m'th value of k â‰¥ 1 for which D(k) = 20010.
# You are given D(4) = 30 (since a_1 = -1/30),
# D(308) = 20010, F(1) = 308, F(10) = 96404.
#
# Find F(10^5).

# THEORY:
#
# The unit term in the formula for k is the Bernoulli number B(k).
# If k is odd and greater than 1, B(k) is zero, so D(k) is 1.
# If n is even, D(k) is the product of all primes p such that p-1 divides n.
#
# 20010 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 23 * 29.
# Thus if 20010 divides D(k), 1, 2, 4, 22, and 28 divide k;
# that is, 308 = 2^2 * 7 * 11 divides k.
#
# The goal then becomes to scan through multiples of 308 which are
# not divisible by any prime-preceder besides 1, 2, 4, 22, and 28.
# We can use a sieve to accomplish this.
