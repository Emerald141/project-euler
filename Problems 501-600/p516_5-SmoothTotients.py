# 5-smooth numbers are numbers whose largest prime factor doesn't exceed 5.
# 5-smooth numbers are also called Hamming numbers.
# Let S(L) be the sum of the numbers n not exceeding L such that Euler's
# totient function Ï†(n) is a Hamming number.
# S(100)=3728.
# 
# Find S(10^12). Give your answer modulo 2^32.
